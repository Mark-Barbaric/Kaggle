## Learning

Various workbooks related to Kaggle Courses

## Tech Layoffs

- tech_layoffs_eda: this is a workbook containing preliminary EDA of the Tech Layoffs dataset.

## Titanic

These notebooks use a number of custom methods which I moved to the kaggle_lib to allow them to be easily used across all of the workbooks.

- titanic_v1.ipynb: this was the first attempt which trained a LogisticRegression model and achieved an accuracy of 77%.
- titanic_multi_model.ipynb: this workbook uses GridSearch to perform hyperparameter tuning, and trains and evaluates multiple models.
